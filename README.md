### Why not overcomplicate friendsgiving and make a mad dash to make a product you can buy on the shelf? 

This was used to cook my turkey for Friendsgiving 2021. These products are readily available on the shelf but it was fun to make my wife roll her eyes. 
I ran the code on a raspberry pi 3 with some sparkfun thermocouple bits and some k-type food safe probes. I had family checking the status of my turkey from across the globe. 

Ignore the blue light filter in the image, this was a screenshot from my phone.
